Hangman is originally believed to be of victorian descent. Although debates have risen about the idea of hanging a man in a childrens game, it is still widely used. The game show Wheel of Fortune is based on Hangman, but with the addtion of a roulette styled wheel and cash awards.

This version of hangman is a interpretation of the dark web's version of the game without all of the actual consequences. No humans actually die and no animals were harmed during the making of this game. :)
